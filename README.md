# Terraform Provider for Infoblox NIOS

The Terraform Provider for Infoblox NIOS allows you to manage your Infoblox NIOS resources such as DNS records, networks, fixed addresses, and more using Terraform. This provider uses the [infoblox-nios-go-client](https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-nios-go-client) for all API calls to interact with the Infoblox NIOS WAPI.

>This release is intended for Early Access Program(EAP) to test in your lab and provide feedback prior to General Availability (GA)

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.18 (to build the provider plugin) (recommended version is 1.24.4 or later)
- [Infoblox NIOS](https://www.infoblox.com/products/nios/) (version 9.0.6 or higher)

## Installation

### Using Pre-built Binaries from Github Releases

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/infobloxopen/terraform-provider-nios/releases).
2. Extract the binary and move it to the Terraform plugins directory (`~/.terraform.d/plugins/`) . Use the following command to create the necessary directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/infobloxopen/nios/0.0.1/<OS_ARCH>(linux_amd64, darwin_amd64, windows_amd64)
mv terraform-provider-nios ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/infobloxopen/nios/0.0.1/<OS_ARCH>
```
3. Additional Step for macOS Users:
   On Apple devices, you must authorize the binary to run by executing the following command once:
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/infobloxopen/nios/0.0.1/<OS_ARCH>/terraform-provider-nios
```

### Build the Provider from Source

Instead of using pre-built binaries, you can build the provider from source. This is useful for development and testing purposes and to build the latest changes pushed to the repository.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/infobloxopen/terraform-provider-nios.git
```

2. Change to the repository directory:
```bash
cd <path-to-provider>/terraform-provider-nios
```

3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use `go mod tidy` to ensure all dependencies are fetched:
```bash
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
```

3. Build and install the provider:
```bash
make build
make install
```

OR instead of `make install`, you can manually move the built binary to the Terraform plugins directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/infobloxopen/nios/0.0.1/<OS_ARCH>(linux_amd64, darwin_amd64, windows_amd64)
mv terraform-provider-nios ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/infobloxopen/nios/0.0.1/<OS_ARCH>
```

4. Additional Step for macOS Users:
   On Apple devices, you must authorize the binary to run by executing the following command once:
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/infobloxopen/nios/0.0.1/<OS_ARCH>/terraform-provider-nios
```



This configuration allows Terraform to use your local provider instead of the one from the Terraform registry, which is particularly useful during development and testing.

## Example Provider Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    nios = {
      source  = "infobloxopen/nios"
      version = "0.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "nios" {
  nios_host_url = "<NIOS_HOST_URL>"
  nios_username = "<NIOS_USERNAME>"
  nios_password = "<NIOS_PASSWORD>"
}
```

### Provider Arguments

- `nios_host_url` - (Required) The full URL of your NIOS Grid Manager (e.g., "https://gridmaster.example.com").
- `nios_username` - (Required) The username to access the NIOS Grid Manager.
- `nios_password` - (Required) The password to access the NIOS Grid Manager.

## Usage Examples

Detailed examples for each resource and data source are available in the `examples` directory of the repository. Each resource and data source has its own directory with sample configurations.

For example:
- Resources examples: `examples/resources/nios_*`
- Data sources examples: `examples/data-sources/nios_*`

Please refer to these examples for detailed usage patterns and configurations.

## Importing Existing Resources

Resources can be imported using their reference ID:

```bash
terraform import nios_dns_record_a.example record:a/ZG5zLmJpbmRfYSQuX2RlZmF1bHQuY29tLmV4YW1wbGUsc2FtcGxlLDE5Mi4xNjguMS4xMA:example.mydomain.com/default
```

Alternatively, you can use Terraform's import blocks (available in Terraform 1.5.0 and later) to declaratively import resources:

```hcl
import {
  to = nios_dns_record_a.example
  id = "record:a/ZG5zLmJpbmRfYSQuX2RlZmF1bHQuY29tLmV4YW1wbGUsc2FtcGxlLDE5Mi4xNjguMS4xMA:example.mydomain.com/default"
}

resource "nios_dns_record_a" "example" {
  # Configuration will be imported from the ID
  # After import, update the configuration as needed
}
```

After running `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`, the resource will be imported and you can then update the configuration as needed.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each resource and data source, including all supported attributes and their descriptions, is available in the `docs` directory of this repository:

- Resource documentation: `docs/resources/`
- Data source documentation: `docs/data-sources/`

Each documentation file contains comprehensive information about:
- Required and optional attributes
- Computed attributes returned by the API
- Examples of usage

We recommend referring to these documentation files for the most up-to-date and detailed information about working with specific NIOS objects.
You can also refer to the [Infoblox NIOS WAPI documentation](https://docs.infoblox.com/space/NIOS/35400616/NIOS) for more information on the API endpoints and their usage.

Alternatively, you can also refer to the [Infoblox NIOS Swagger](https://infobloxopen.github.io/nios-swagger/) to view the API endpoints and their parameters.

## Debugging

### Terraform Logging

Terraform has detailed logs that can help debug provider issues. To enable them, set the `TF_LOG` environment variable to one of the log levels: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform plan

# For Windows PowerShell
$env:TF_LOG="DEBUG"
terraform plan
```

The `TRACE` level is the most verbose and will include all API calls made by the provider to the Infoblox NIOS WAPI.

### Provider-Specific Debugging

For debugging specific issues with the NIOS provider:

1. Use `DEBUG` or `TRACE` log levels to see the API requests and responses
2. Check the request body and response status codes for API errors
3. Verify the WAPI version compatibility with your NIOS Grid Manager
4. Ensure correct credentials and permissions in the NIOS system

For more information on debugging Terraform providers, refer to the [Terraform debugging documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/debugging).

##  Terraform Limitations / Anomalies and Known Issues

- DHCP Options:
  - DHCP Options:
    - Both `name` and `num` fields are required when configuring DHCP options
    - For IPv6 (Network / Network Container): When setting `dhcp-lease-time` during initial creation or updation operations does not take effect
    - When `use_options = true` is set and all options are subsequently removed, no change is detected
    - If `use_options` is set to `false`, changes are detected but may not reflect properly in the UI
- Cloud platform configuration must be nullified before modification or removal
- Cannot specify reverse mapping notation for Zone FQDNs (Auth, Forward, Delegated)
- Forward Zones lack TSIG support
- IPv6 PTR records lack function call support.
- Range templates have `cloud_api_compatible` set to `true` by default, as Terraform's internal ID structure requires cloud compatibility. Setting this to `false` causes errors when adding the Terraform Internal ID extensible attribute.
- DHCP Range Configuration:
  - `cloud_info` cannot be configured via Terraform because `delegated_member` is a computed field
  - `use_ignore_id` parameter requires explicit setting to `false` to unset it after initial configuration
- DTC Pool Configuration:
  - When setting `availability` to `quorum`, you must explicitly define the `quorum` field or the operation will fail.
  - Once the `quorum` field is added to the Terraform configuration, it cannot be removed.
- Data Source provides no value for `extattrs_all` since this is for internal use only. Users should only work with the `extattrs` field.
- Extensible Attributes (EA):
  - CLI Import doesn't segregate EA into `extattrs` and `extattrs_all`
  - Requires another apply operation
  - Import block works as expected, contrary to CLI import
- String Field unsetting issues explicitly require to pass empty string to unset.
- `ignore_id` & `ignore_client_identifier` field usage:
  - For shared networks in WAPI 1.8 or higher, use `ignore_id` instead of `ignore_client_identifier`
  - Using the wrong field based on WAPI version will cause configuration errors.
- When setting `use_ttl=false` or removing the field, the provider fails to unset TTL properly. Users must remove both `ttl` and `use_ttl` fields to successfully unset TTL.
- NS Record type lacks Extensible Attribute support, preventing effective state drift detection via Terraform Internal ID.
- Function call next_available_network for IPv4/IPv6 networks fails during subsequent terraform apply operations with "overlap an existing network" error.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

### Terraform RC Configuration for local usage

As the Provider isn't available on registry , to develop the provider locally , you need to set up the `.terraformrc` file in your home directory to point to the `terraform-provider-nios` repository.

```bash
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "infobloxopen/nios" = "/Users/<user-name>/<path-to-provider>/terraform-provider-nios"
  }
  filesystem_mirror {
    path    = "/Users/<user-name>/.terraform.d/plugins/"
    include = ["infobloxopen/nios"]
  }
  direct {
    exclude = ["infobloxopen/nios"]
  }
}
```
Using this configuration allows Terraform to use the local provider instead of the one from the Terraform registry, which is particularly useful during development and testing.
