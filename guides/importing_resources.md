## Importing Existing Resources

Resources can be imported using their reference ID:

```bash
terraform import nios_dns_record_a.example record:a/ZG5zLmJpbmRfYSQuX2RlZmF1bHQuY29tLmV4YW1wbGUsc2FtcGxlLDE5Mi4xNjguMS4xMA:example.mydomain.com/default
```

You can use Terraform's import blocks (available in Terraform 1.5.0 and later) to declaratively import resources:

```hcl
import {
  to = nios_dns_record_a.example
  id = "record:a/ZG5zLmJpbmRfYSQuX2RlZmF1bHQuY29tLmV4YW1wbGUsc2FtcGxlLDE5Mi4xNjguMS4xMA:example.mydomain.com/default"
}

resource "nios_dns_record_a" "example" {
  # Configuration will be imported from the ID
  # After import, update the configuration as needed
}
```

After running `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`, the resource will be imported and you can then update the configuration as needed.

You can generate a plan config and then use it to import a resource. This is in beta version and is supported in terraform version 1.7.0 or later.
Below is the command to generate the same.

```
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```

Once the config is generated you can execute the `terraform apply` command to import the resource and you can then update the configuration as needed.
